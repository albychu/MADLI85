If you blank a hole for someone else, you'll fall into it.
A lie blank round the world while truth is putting her boots on.
No one blank the depth of a river with both feet
Speaking without thinking is like blank without taking aim.
Donâ€™t blank all your eggs in one basket.
Early bird blank the worm.
