Oh the weather outside is ADJECTIVE1
But the fire is so ADJECTIVE2
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
It doesn't show signs of VERB1 ing
And I've bought some corn for VERB2 ing
The lights are turned way down ADJECTIVE3
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
